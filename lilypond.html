        Not too long ago, I started using
        <a href="https://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a> to typeset some of the
        sheet music for my school work. I find it very easy to get used to in
        comparisons to many other music notation software I've used before.
        Here's the <a href="https://github.com/yzhou216/scores">link</a> to my
        repository in case you want to check it out.
